## Learning Path & Resources 📖

### Learning Strategy:
1. **Start with Basics** - Master arrays, strings, and basic data structures
2. **Progress Systematically** - Move from simple to complex data structures
3. **Practice Daily** - Solve at least 2-3 problems every day
4. **Review Patterns** - Focus on problem-solving patterns, not just solutions
5. **Mock Interviews** - Practice with real interview scenarios

### Recommended Practice Platforms:
- **LeetCode** - Comprehensive problem set with company tags
- **HackerRank** - Structured learning paths
- **Codeforces** - Competitive programming practice
- **InterviewBit** - Interview-focused problems
- **GeeksforGeeks** - Tutorial-based learning

### Time Allocation:
- **Beginner**: 3-4 months for fundamentals (Chapters 1-10)
- **Intermediate**: 2-3 months for advanced topics (Chapters 11-18)
- **Advanced**: 1-2 months for interview prep (Chapters 19-22)

### Tips for Success:
- **Consistency > Intensity** - Regular practice beats cramming
- **Understand, Don't Memorize** - Focus on understanding patterns
- **Code from Scratch** - Implement data structures yourself
- **Analyze Complexity** - Always consider time and space complexity
- **Review and Revise** - Regularly revisit previously learned concepts
