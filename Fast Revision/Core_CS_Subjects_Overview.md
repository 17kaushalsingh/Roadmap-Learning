# Core CS Subjects Overview 🎯

## Why Core CS Subjects Matter 📚

**Google might skip it, but almost every other company from startups to FAANG will grill you on core computer science subjects: SQL, OOPS, OS, Networks, DBMS.**

### **These aren't just theoretical subjects - they can be deal breakers**

**Companies don't want you to format definitions. They want you to understand things and explain why things need to be done this way and not the other way.**

### **Real Interview Examples**:
- **How would you use indexes in SQL?**
- **How would you avoid deadlocks in operating systems?**
- **Why would you prefer UDP over TCP in a gaming app?**

### **Why These Rounds Matter**:
- **Measures depth of knowledge**
- **Tests practical understanding**
- **Reveals foundation strength**
- **Even if you're very good at DSA, weak foundations can break your interview**
