# Chapter 13: Indexing in DBMS 📚

## What is Indexing? 🔍

**Indexing is used to optimise the performance of a database by minimising the number of disk accesses required when a query is processed.**

**The index is a type of data structure. It is used to locate and access the data in a database table quickly.**

### Key Benefits:
- **Speeds up read operations** like SELECT queries, WHERE clause, etc.
- **Reduces disk I/O** operations
- **Improves query performance** significantly

### Index Components 📋

#### 1. Search Key
**Contains copy of primary key or candidate key of the table or something else.**

- Can be primary key, candidate key, or any attribute
- Used for searching and locating data

#### 2. Data Reference
**Pointer holding the address of disk block where the value of the corresponding key is stored.**

- Points to actual data location on disk
- Enables direct access to data records

### Important Notes 📝

- **Indexing is optional**, but increases access speed
- **Not the primary means to access tuples** - it's the secondary means
- **Index file is always sorted**
- **Trade-offs**: Faster reads vs. slower writes

## Indexing Methods 🗂️

### 1. Primary Index (Clustering Index) 🏗️

#### Definition
**A file may have several indices, on different search keys. If the data file containing the records is sequentially ordered, a Primary index is an index whose search key also defines the sequential order of the file.**

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Data file is sequentially ordered** on the search key
- **Search key defines file order**
- **NOTE**: The term primary index is sometimes used to mean an index on a primary key. However, such usage is nonstandard and should be avoided.

#### Important Point:
**All files are ordered sequentially on some search key. It could be Primary Key or non-primary key.**

#### **How Primary Indexing Makes Access Faster** ⚡

Since both the **index file and data file are sorted**, we can use **binary search** instead of linear search:

**Without Index (Linear Search)**:
```
Data File: [101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109]
Find 108: Check every element sequentially → 8 comparisons
```

**With Primary Index (Binary Search)**:
```
Index: [101, 104, 107]
Find 108:
Step 1: Check middle (104) → 108 > 104, search right
Step 2: Check rightmost (107) → 108 > 107, go to next block
Step 3: Scan block starting from 107 → find 108 in 2 comparisons
Total: 5 comparisons vs 8 without index
```

**Performance Benefits**:
- **O(log n)** search instead of **O(n)**
- **Fewer disk I/O operations**
- **Binary search on index + sequential scan within block**
- **Significantly faster for large datasets**

### Dense And Sparse Indices 📊

#### 1. Dense Index 🔍
**The dense index contains an index record for every search key value in the data file.**

**Characteristics**:
- **Index record for EVERY search key value**
- Contains search-key value and pointer to first data record
- Rest of records with same search-key stored sequentially

**Visual Example**:
```
Data File (Sorted by Student_ID):
101 | John | CS
102 | Jane | EC
103 | Mike | CS
104 | Sara | IT

Dense Index:
101 → Pointer to Record 101
102 → Pointer to Record 102
103 → Pointer to Record 103
104 → Pointer to Record 104
```

**Pros and Cons**:
- ✅ **Fast searching**: Can locate any record directly
- ❌ **More space**: Needs space for every index record
- ❌ **Overhead**: Index records have search key + pointer for each record

#### 2. Sparse Index 🎯
**An index record appears for only some of the search-key values.**

**Characteristics**:
- **Index record for SOME search key values**
- Range of index columns stores same data block address
- When data needs retrieval, block address fetched

**Visual Example**:
```
Data File (Sorted by Student_ID):
101 | John | CS  | Block 1
102 | Jane | EC  | Block 1
103 | Mike | CS  | Block 2
104 | Sara | IT  | Block 2
105 | Tom  | ME  | Block 3

Sparse Index:
101 → Pointer to Block 1  (First record in block)
103 → Pointer to Block 2  (First record in block)
105 → Pointer to Block 3  (First record in block)
```

**Pros and Cons**:
- ✅ **Less space**: Fewer index records
- ✅ **Efficient**: Resolves dense indexing issues
- ❌ **Slower search**: May need to scan within block

### Primary Indexing Types 📚

#### Based on Key Attribute
**Data file is sorted w.r.t primary key attribute.**

**Characteristics**:
- **Primary Key used as search-key in Index**
- **Sparse Index will be formed**
- **Number of entries in index file = number of blocks in data file**

**Example**:
```
Data File (Sorted by Student_ID - Primary Key):
Block 1: 101, 102, 103
Block 2: 104, 105, 106
Block 3: 107, 108, 109

Primary Index (Sparse):
101 → Pointer to Block 1
104 → Pointer to Block 2
107 → Pointer to Block 3
```

#### Based on Non-Key Attribute
**Data file is sorted w.r.t non-key attribute.**

**Characteristics**:
- **Number of entries = unique non-key attribute values**
- **This is dense index** (all unique values have entry)
- **Clustering index for grouping**

**Example**:
```
Data File (Sorted by Department - Non-Key):
101 | John  | CS
103 | Mike  | CS
105 | Tom   | CS
102 | Jane  | EC
104 | Sara  | IT

Primary Index (Dense):
CS  → Pointer to first CS record (101)
EC  → Pointer to first EC record (102)
IT  → Pointer to first IT record (104)
```

**Real-World Example**:
**Let's assume a company recruited many employees in various departments. In this case, clustering indexing should be created for all employees who belong to the same dept.**

### 2. Multi-level Index 📊

#### Definition
**Index with two or more levels.**

#### Why Multi-level Index?
**If the single level index becomes so large that the binary search itself would take much time, we can break down indexing into multiple levels.**

**Visual Example**:
```
Level 1 (Top Level):
CS  → Pointer to Level 2 for CS
EC  → Pointer to Level 2 for EC
IT  → Pointer to Level 2 for IT

Level 2 (Second Level):
CS-101 → Pointer to Data Block
CS-103 → Pointer to Data Block
EC-102 → Pointer to Data Block
IT-104 → Pointer to Data Block
```

**Benefits**:
- **Reduces search time** for very large indexes
- **Hierarchical structure** like B+ trees
- **Efficient disk access** pattern

---

### 3. Secondary Index (Non-Clustering Index) 🔗

#### Definition
**Data file is unsorted. Hence, Primary Indexing is not possible.**

**Characteristics**:
- **Data file is unsorted**
- **Can be done on key or non-key attribute**
- **Called secondary indexing** because normally one indexing is already applied
- **Number of entries = number of records in data file**
- **It's an example of Dense index**

**Example**:
```
Unsorted Data File:
104 | Sara | IT
101 | John | CS
103 | Mike | CS
102 | Jane | EC

Secondary Index (Dense):
101 → Pointer to Record 101
102 → Pointer to Record 102
103 → Pointer to Record 103
104 → Pointer to Record 104
```

#### **How Secondary Indexing Makes Access Faster** ⚡

Even though the **actual data file is unsorted**, the **secondary index itself is sorted**:

**Without Index (Linear Search)**:
```
Unsorted Data File: [104, 101, 103, 102]
Find 102: Check every element → 4 comparisons
Worst case: Check all records → O(n)
```

**With Secondary Index (Binary Search)**:
```
Sorted Index: [101, 102, 103, 104]
Find 102:
Step 1: Check middle (103) → 102 < 103, search left
Step 2: Check left middle (102) → Found!
Total: 2 comparisons vs 4 without index
```

**Performance Benefits**:
- **O(log n)** search on sorted index instead of **O(n)** linear scan
- **Index fits in memory** for faster access
- **Direct pointer to data record** after finding index entry
- **Much faster than scanning entire unsorted data file**

**When to Use**:
- When data file cannot be sorted
- When multiple search keys needed
- When flexible access patterns required

## Interview Questions 🎯

### Q1: What is the difference between Dense and Sparse indexes?
**Answer**:
- **Dense Index**: Contains index record for EVERY search key value, more space but faster access
- **Sparse Index**: Contains index record for SOME search key values, less space but slower access
- **Dense Example**: Every Student_ID has index entry
- **Sparse Example**: Only first Student_ID in each block has index entry

### Q2: When would you use a Secondary Index instead of Primary Index?
**Answer**:
- When data file cannot be sorted (unsorted data)
- When multiple search keys are needed
- When flexible access patterns are required
- When clustering is not important
- **Example**: Search by product name when data is sorted by product ID

### Q3: Why is Primary Index based on Primary Key always sparse?
**Answer**:
- Primary key values are unique and ordered
- Each block contains multiple primary key values
- Only need to point to first record in each block
- Number of index entries = number of blocks (much smaller than number of records)
- **Saves significant space** while maintaining search efficiency

### Q4: What is the purpose of Multi-level indexing?
**Answer**:
- Used when single-level index becomes too large
- Reduces search time for very large datasets
- Breaks down indexing into multiple levels
- Similar to B+ tree structure
- **Example**: Million-record table with primary index on ID

### Q5: How does indexing affect database performance?
**Answer**:
**Positive Effects**:
- Faster SELECT queries
- Efficient WHERE clause processing
- Improved JOIN operations
- Better sorting and grouping

**Negative Effects**:
- Slower INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
- Additional storage space required
- Index maintenance overhead
- Potential fragmentation over time

### Q6: Explain clustering index with a real-world example
**Answer**:
**Example**: Company employees database sorted by department
- Data file sorted by department (non-key attribute)
- Primary index created on department (dense index)
- All employees from same department stored together
- **Benefit**: Fast retrieval of all employees from specific department
- **Use Case**: Generate department-wise reports efficiently

### Q7: How exactly does indexing make database operations faster?
**Answer**:
**Primary Indexing Speed**:
- **Binary Search** on sorted index: O(log n) instead of linear search O(n)
- **Example**: Find 108 in 9 records → 5 comparisons vs 8 without index
- **Fewer disk I/Os**: Read index blocks + specific data blocks

**Secondary Indexing Speed**:
- **Index is sorted even if data isn't**: Binary search on index
- **Direct access**: Index entry → Direct pointer to data record
- **Example**: Find 102 in unsorted data → 2 comparisons vs 4 linear scan
- **Memory efficiency**: Index fits in memory, data stays on disk

**Key Performance Gains**:
- **O(log n) vs O(n)** search complexity
- **Reduced disk accesses** (most expensive operation)
- **Index caching** for frequently accessed data
- **Parallel processing** possible with index lookups

### Q8: Why are secondary indexes always dense?
**Answer**:
- **Data file is unsorted**: Cannot use sparse indexing
- **No predictable pattern**: Need entry for every record
- **Sorted index structure**: Enables binary search regardless of data order
- **Direct access requirement**: Each record must be directly locatable
- **Example**: Unsorted data [104,101,103,102] needs index entries for all values to enable fast search

Without dense indexing, you'd have to scan entire unsorted data file, defeating the purpose of indexing.
