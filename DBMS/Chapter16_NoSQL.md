# Chapter 16: NoSQL Databases 🚀

## What is NoSQL? 🤔

**NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph.**

**They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.**

### Key Characteristics 📋

1. **Schema Free**: No predefined schema structure
2. **Flexible Data Structures**: Not tabular, dynamically adjustable
3. **Big Data Handling**: Can handle huge amounts of data efficiently
4. **Open Source**: Most NoSQL databases are open source
5. **Horizontal Scaling**: Capability to scale across multiple servers
6. **Alternative Storage**: Stores data in non-relational formats

## History Behind NoSQL 📚

### Emergence in Late 2000s

**NoSQL databases emerged in the late 2000s as the cost of storage dramatically decreased. Gone were the days of needing to create a complex, difficult-to-manage data model in order to avoid data duplication.**

### Key Drivers 🚀

#### 1. **Cost Shift: Storage to Development**
- **Storage became cheap** → Complex data modeling no longer necessary
- **Developer time became expensive** → NoSQL optimized for developer productivity
- **Rapid development** needed over storage optimization

#### 2. **Unstructured Data Growth**
- **Data becoming more unstructured**
- **Schema definition became costly**
- **Flexibility needed** for changing data structures
- **NoSQL allows storage of huge amounts of unstructured data**

#### 3. **Agile Development Requirements**
- **Need for rapid adaptation** to changing requirements
- **Iterative development** throughout the entire software stack
- **Database-level flexibility** for quick iterations
- **NoSQL gave developers this flexibility**

#### 4. **Cloud Computing Revolution**
- **Public cloud hosting** for applications and data
- **Data distribution** across multiple servers and regions
- **Application resilience** through distributed architecture
- **Scale-out instead of scale-up** strategies
- **Geo-placement** capabilities for data optimization
- **MongoDB and others** provided these cloud-friendly features

## NoSQL Databases Advantages ✅

### A. Flexible Schema 🔄

**RDBMS has pre-defined schema, which becomes an issue when we do not have all the data with us or we need to change the schema. It's a huge task to change schema on the go.**

**Benefits**:
- **Dynamic schema changes** without downtime
- **Add/remove fields** on the fly
- **Different data structures** in same collection
- **Rapid prototyping** and iteration

### B. Horizontal Scaling 📈

**Horizontal scaling, also known as scale-out, refers to bringing on additional nodes to share the load. This is difficult with relational databases due to the difficulty in spreading out related data across nodes.**

---

## Database Scaling Types 📊

### Types of Scaling

#### 1. Vertical Scaling (Scale-Up) ⬆️
**Adding more resources (CPU, RAM, SSD) to a single server**

**Characteristics**:
- **Single server** with increased capacity
- **Simple implementation** - just add resources
- **Limited by hardware** - physical constraints
- **Downtime required** for upgrading

**Advantages**:

- No code changes needed
- Consistent performance
- Good for small to medium applications

**Disadvantages**:
- **Physical limits** on hardware capacity
- **Single point of failure**
- **Expensive** - high-end hardware costs
- **Vendor lock-in**

#### 2. Horizontal Scaling (Scale-Out) ➡️
**Adding more servers to distribute the load**

**Characteristics**:
- **Multiple servers** sharing the workload
- **Distributed architecture** across machines
- **Theoretically unlimited** scaling capacity
- **Fault tolerance** - if one server fails, others continue

**Advantages**:
- **Unlimited growth** potential
- **Better fault tolerance**
- **Cost-effective** using commodity hardware
- **Geographic distribution** possible

**Disadvantages**:

## Scaling Capabilities: SQL vs NoSQL ⚖️

### SQL Databases Scaling

#### **Primary Scaling Method: Vertical Scaling**
- **Scale-up** is the primary approach for traditional databases
- **Horizontal scaling** is **very difficult** due to:
  - **ACID transaction requirements** across distributed nodes
  - **JOIN operations** across multiple servers
  - **Referential integrity** constraints
  - **Data consistency** maintenance

#### **Limited Horizontal Scaling Support**:
```
Traditional SQL Database Scale-out Challenges:

┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Server 1       │    │   Server 2       │
│   (Table A, B)     │    │   (Table C, D)     │
│   ──────────────   │◄──►│   ──────────────   │
│  JOIN Table A      │    │  JOIN Table B      │
│  with Table C      │    │  with Table D      │
│  ❌ Requires     │    │  ❌ Requires     │
│  Cross-Server    │    │  Cross-Server    │
│  JOIN Operation   │    │  JOIN Operation   │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

#### **SQL Horizontal Scaling Attempts**:
- **Database Sharding**: Manual partitioning of data

└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

#### **Horizontal Scaling Implementation Methods**:

##### 1. **Sharding** 🎯
**Partitioning data across multiple servers based on a key**

**Sharding Strategies**:
- **Range-based**: Data partitioned by key ranges
- **Hash-based**: Data distributed using hash function
- **Geographic**: Data distributed by location
- **Directory-based**: Central lookup service for data location

**Example**:
```
User Data Sharding:
Server 1: Users A-F (user_id: 1-1000)
Server 2: Users G-L (user_id: 1001-2000)
Server 3: Users M-Z (user_id: 2001-3000)
```

##### 2. **Replica-Sets** 🔄
**Data replication for high availability and read scaling**

**Replica Set Structure**:
```
Primary Node  ◄───┐

- **Mixed workloads** with different requirements

---

## Key Takeaways on Scaling 💡

1. **SQL = Vertical**, **NoSQL = Horizontal** (general rule)
2. **Scaling limits**: SQL has physical limits, NoSQL has network limits only
3. **Complexity**: SQL scaling is simpler, NoSQL is more complex
4. **Cost**: SQL scaling is expensive, NoSQL scaling is cost-effective
5. **Consistency**: SQL provides strong consistency, NoSQL provides eventual consistency
6. **Use Cases**: Choose based on application requirements, not just technology preference
7. **Hybrid approaches**: Many successful systems use both SQL and NoSQL together
8. **Implementation**: NoSQL requires more operational expertise and management

**Remember**: Scaling is not just about adding more servers - it's about designing your system architecture to handle growth efficiently. Choose the right scaling strategy based on your specific application requirements and constraints! 🚀

### C. High Availability 🛡️

**NoSQL databases are highly available due to its auto replication feature i.e. whenever any kind of failure happens data replicates itself to the preceding consistent state.**

**Availability Features**:
- **Auto replication** of data across multiple servers
- **Failover support** when server fails
- **Multi-server data storage** for redundancy
- **Automatic recovery** to consistent state
- **Zero downtime** during server failures

### D. Easy Insert and Read Operations ⚡

**Queries in NoSQL databases can be faster than SQL databases. Why? Data in SQL databases is typically normalised, so queries for a single object or entity require you to join data from multiple tables. As your tables grow in size, the joins can become expensive.**

**Performance Benefits**:
- **Data accessed together, stored together** (MongoDB principle)
- **No expensive JOINs** required
- **Optimized for read-heavy operations**
- **Fast single-document queries**

**Trade-offs**:
- **Fast INSERT and READ operations**
- **Complex DELETE or UPDATE operations**

## NoSQL DB Misconceptions ❌

### 1. "Relationship data is best suited for relational databases"

**Common misconception is that NoSQL databases don't store relationship data well. NoSQL databases can store relationship data — they just store it differently than relational databases do.**

**Reality**:
- **Related data can be nested** within single document
- **No need to split related data** across multiple tables
- **Easier relationship modeling** in many cases
- **Direct relationships** without JOIN complexity

### 2. "NoSQL databases don't support ACID transactions"

**Another common misconception is that NoSQL databases don't support ACID transactions. Some NoSQL databases like MongoDB do, in fact, support ACID transactions.**

**Reality**:
- **MongoDB supports ACID transactions**
- **Document databases** maintain consistency within documents
- **Multi-document transactions** available in newer versions
- **Not all NoSQL databases** lack ACID support

---

## Types of NoSQL Data Models 🗂️

### 1. Key-Value Stores 🔑

**The simplest type of NoSQL database is a key-value store. Every data element in the database is stored as a key value pair consisting of an attribute name (or "key") and a value.**

**Characteristics**:
- **Simple structure**: Like dictionary/map object
- **Efficient indexing**: Constant time O(1) lookup
- **Flexible values**: Can store any data type
- **Compact storage**: Minimal overhead

**Example**:
```
Key: "user_session_123"
Value: {
  "user_id": 456,
  "login_time": "2023-01-01T10:00:00",
  "preferences": ["dark_mode", "notifications"]
}
```

**Use Cases**:
- **Shopping carts**: User session management
- **User preferences**: Settings and configurations
- **User profiles**: Basic profile information
- **Real-time data**: Gaming, finance applications
- **Caching mechanisms**: Frequently accessed data
- **Simple key-based queries**: Configuration lookups

**Popular Examples**: Oracle NoSQL, Amazon DynamoDB, Redis

### 2. Column-Oriented / Columnar / C-Store / Wide-Column 📊

**The data is stored such that each row of a column will be next to other rows from that same column.**

**How It Works**:
- **Column-based storage** instead of row-based
- **Efficient compression** for similar data types
- **Fast analytics** on specific columns
- **Read only needed columns** instead of entire rows

**Example Structure**:
```
Traditional Row Store:
Row 1: [101, John, CS, Mumbai]
Row 2: [102, Jane, EC, Delhi]
Row 3: [103, Mike, CS, Bangalore]

Column Store:
Column ID: [101, 102, 103]
Column Name: [John, Jane, Mike]
Column Dept: [CS, EC, CS]
Column City: [Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore]
```

**Advantages**:
- **Fast aggregation** (sum, average, count)
- **Efficient compression** on column data
- **I/O optimization** for analytics queries
- **Selective column reading**

**Use Cases**:
- **Analytics platforms**
- **Business intelligence**
- **Data warehousing**
- **Time-series data**
- **Big data analytics**

**Popular Examples**: Cassandra, RedShift, Snowflake, HBase

### 3. Document-Based Stores 📄

**This DB store data in documents similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. Each document contains pairs of fields and values.**

**Characteristics**:
- **JSON-like documents**: Flexible structure
- **Rich data types**: Strings, numbers, arrays, objects
- **Schema flexibility**: Documents can have different structures
- **ACID properties**: Suitable for transactions

**Example Document**:
```json
{
  "_id": "12345",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "age": 30,
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "New York",
    "zip": "10001"
  },
  "orders": [
    {"product_id": "P001", "quantity": 2, "price": 99.99},
    {"product_id": "P002", "quantity": 1, "price": 149.99}
  ],
  "preferences": ["email_notifications", "sms_alerts"]
}
```

**Use Cases**:
- **E-commerce platforms**: Product catalogs, user data
- **Trading platforms**: Financial transactions, portfolios
- **Mobile applications**: User data, content management
- **Content management**: Blogs, articles, media
- **IoT applications**: Sensor data, device management

**Popular Examples**: MongoDB, CouchDB, DocumentDB

### 4. Graph-Based Stores 🕸️

**A graph database focuses on the relationship between data elements. Each element is stored as a node (such as a person in a social media graph). The connections between elements are called links or relationships.**

**Characteristics**:
- **Nodes**: Data entities (people, products, posts)
- **Edges**: Relationships between entities
- **First-class relationships**: Stored directly in database
- **Optimized for traversals**: Efficient relationship queries

**Example Structure**:
```
Nodes:
- Person: {id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 25}
- Person: {id: 2, name: "Bob", age: 30}
- Post: {id: 1, title: "Hello World", content: "My first post"}

Edges:
- FRIENDS_WITH: (Person 1) → (Person 2)
- LIKES: (Person 2) → (Post 1)
- AUTHORED: (Person 1) → (Post 1)
```

**Advantages**:
- **Fast relationship queries**: No complex JOINs needed
- **Natural modeling**: Direct representation of relationships
- **Efficient traversals**: Optimized for graph algorithms
- **Pattern matching**: Find complex relationship patterns

**Use Cases**:
- **Social networks**: Friends, followers, connections
- **Fraud detection**: Transaction patterns, suspicious activities
- **Knowledge graphs**: Concept relationships, ontologies
- **Recommendation engines**: Similar users, products
- **Network analysis**: Infrastructure, supply chains

**Important Note**: **Very few real-world business systems can survive solely on graph queries. As a result, graph databases are usually run alongside other more traditional databases.**

**Popular Examples**: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, ArangoDB

**Impact**:
- **Larger storage requirements** due to denormalization
- **Data duplication** for query optimization
- **Storage costs**: Currently cheap, but still a consideration
- **Compression**: Some NoSQL databases support compression to reduce footprint

### 2. Update & Delete Operations are Costly 💰

**Challenges with Write Operations**:
- **Complex updates** due to nested data structures
- **Multiple document updates** for related data changes
- **Slower performance** compared to relational databases
- **Consistency maintenance** across distributed systems

### 3. All Type of NoSQL Data Model Doesn't Fulfil All Your Application Needs 🎯

- **Graph Databases**: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune - Nodes and edges for social networks, relationships

### Q5: What are the main disadvantages of NoSQL databases?
**Answer**:
- **Data redundancy** due to denormalization for query optimization
- **Complex update/delete operations** on nested data structures
- **Limited ACID support** in some databases
- **No consistency constraints** at database level
- **Not ideal for all use cases** - specialized for specific scenarios

### Q6: How does NoSQL achieve horizontal scaling?
**Answer**:
- **Sharding**: Data partitioning across multiple servers
- **Replica-sets**: Data replication for high availability
- **Self-contained data structures** that can be distributed easily
- **No complex JOINs** required across different nodes
- **Cloud-friendly architecture** designed for distributed systems
